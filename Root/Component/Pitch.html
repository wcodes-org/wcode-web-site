	<p>
		I have always wondered - why do we all still have to go through the same troubles when exchanging numbers especially over phone by speech. Isn't there a better way?
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>How often mistakes are made when sending IDs like mobile numbers and email addresses</li>
		<li>In absence of a pen, having to remember even a 10 digit number can become a difficult task</li>
		<li>If there is no internet or pen-drive - how to send a small digital file?</li>
		<li>What if correct delivery is a matter of life and death?</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		<a class="content-link XHRef" href="/" data-xhref="wcode">WCode</a> is the answer.
	</p>

	<h2>What is WCode?</h2>
	<p>
		An encoding schema to convert digital data into literal words. It is similar to bar-codes and QR-codes but different in that it is human readable.
	</p>
	<div id="codes-example">
		<table id="codes-table">
			<tbody>
				<tr class="code_label">
					<td>
						Bar Code
					</td>
					<td>
						QR Code

					<td>
						WCode
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="Code">

					</td>
					<td>
						<img src="/resource/w_code.png" alt="WCode : \ Cat Rock Friend Tomato /" />
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr class="code_value">
					<td>
						123456
					</td>
					<td>

	<h2>What does it do?</h2>
	<p>
		Converts data like Numbers, Email addresses or URLs and even small digital files into a bunch of words.
	</p>

	<h2>How is it useful?</h2>
	<p>
		When asked for your telephone no. wouldn't it be nice if you had to say only four words instead of the usual ten. For example:<br>
		"<strong><em>Cat Apple Mango Tomato</em></strong>" against "<strong><em>Nine Eight Zero One Two Three Four Five Six Seven</em></strong>".<br><br>
		Also the chances of making mistakes are reduced since only carefully handpicked words that are simple and unambiguous and have distinct pronunciation are used.<br><br>
		Additionally check-summed WCode can be used to ensure correct delivery.
	</p>
	<h2>Where can it be used?</h2>
	<p>Where ever a human being is in-between a short digital communication across two non-connected computer systems. For example:<br>
	You need to tell your friend your bank account number. Even a single mistake can be disatrous. If you cannot SMS or email - and you must use traditional methods like writing or voice, WCode may be the best option.</p>
