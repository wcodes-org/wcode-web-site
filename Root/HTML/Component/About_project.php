	Once while having to enter sequences of hexadecimal nibbles - I realised how - tedious and error-prone the process was.<br>
	<br>
	Thinking of how hex-symbols represent binary bits - <br>
	<blockquote>
		I thought of the idea of substituting the symbols with objects like 'Apple' and 'Mango',<br>
		and subsequently &ndash; with their names.
	</blockquote>
	I began developing a Windows GUI application written in C++.<br>
	<br>
	I found, much later, the website: <a class='content-link' href='http://shoutkey.com'>ShoutKey.com</a> by <em>Chad Etzel</em><br>
	It too uses word codes but it's dictionary is liberal and the application is limited only to shortened temporary URLs.
