			<h2><span class="bullet">•</span>Problem</h2>
			<div class="indent-60">
				<p>
					Even in the GPS age, why do addresses have to be so complicated ?
				</p>
				<p>
					They are generally too non-standardized, lengthy and ambiguous.<br>
					Also, often very imprecise.
				</p>
				<p>
					And even the latitude and longitude coordinates are too complex numbers to be used by the general public.<br>
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div>
			<h2><span class="bullet">•</span>Solution</h2>
			<div class="indent-60">
				<p>
					Not any more! Now addresses can be super-short and simple.
				</p>
				<p>
					The WCode location app can take you to any point in a city using just three very simple words.
				</p>
				<p>
					Basically,<br>
					It’s a PIN code to your door, but of words.

			<h2><span class="bullet"></span>Comparision</h2>
			<div class="indent-60">
				<p>
					Other competing systems use alphabets and numbers.<br>
					For end users they don’t help much
				</p>
				<p>
					One system uses words but their dictionary comprises of thousands of words and thus includes difficult pronunciation and spellings - defeating the very purpose
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>WCode location uses only 1024 basic words</strong>
