	WCodes can be integrated into existing and new systems in the following two ways:
	<ul class="content-list">
		<li>
			<div class="content-li-title">Active</div>
			The WCode sub system can be inserted into an existing system.<br />
			Both the sender and receiver will require the WCode converter attached to the IO Channel.
			<div class="diagram">
				<img src="/resource/adoption-active.png" alt="encoder and decoder embedded in sender and receiver respectively" />
			</div>
			A WCode Encoder will encode the output right before it is dispatched to the receiver.<br />
			A WCode Decoder will decode it back to the original data before processing it further.<br />
			<br />
			e.g. Two-Factor authentication systems like One Time Password (OTP) &ndash; SMS.
		</li>
		<li>
			<div class="content-li-title">Passive</div>
			Without modifying the receiving system &ndash; a separate standalone tool can be used to input WCodes and<br />
			&ndash; relay decoded data directly to the target.
			<div class="diagram">
				<img src="/resource/adoption-passive.png" alt="encoder may or maynot be embedded in sender; standalone decoder at receiver end" />
			</div>
			<br />
			e.g. A separate software, similar to the <em>Google Transliterate Tool</em>, can take WCode input and relay the decoded data to, say, a designated field of a GUI form.
		</li>
	</ul>
</div>
